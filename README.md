# 3dwrx-Cup-Holder-Replacement-V1.0
**Smartphone, Key and Card Holder**

## Purpose of 3dwrx-Cup-Holder-Replacement-V1.0
This design follows after a successful usage of the design for Audi A6 C7 ash tray replacement. We have decided to extend our portfolio to Audi A4 B9 as well. 
Since Audi has no applicable ash tray to use we have decided to make a solution on top of the cup holders.
The cup holders are too small for proper usage, so our idea is to use them more effectively as a smartphone, key, and cardholder.

There is nothing specific about this case. Just print the design and you can organize your space much better.

## Disclaimer:
However, since most of the application is depending on the assembly, the chosen components other then the mount, the level of adjustment from your side, the print settings as well as the particular environment you want to use the solution, it might be good to take it with a grain of salt. Iâ€˜m not granting any warranty nor taking any responsibility for this solution to work in your case. Please check upon using if the solution can work for you in your particular use case following own steps for qualification such as checking the setup and components before using and considering and checking own laws and regulations before bringing the solution into action.
