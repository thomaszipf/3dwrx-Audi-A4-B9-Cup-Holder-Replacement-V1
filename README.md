**Why this design?**

After the successful Audi A6 C7 Design that enables drivers to place the key in the original ash tray, we have seen big popularity for that design.
So we decided to extend our portfolio to Audi A4 B9 as well.
Since Audi A4 B9 has no applicable ash tray to use, we decided to build the solution on top of the cup holders.
This cup holders are however too small for proper usage. I hope we made the right choice.
